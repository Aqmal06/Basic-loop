# Introduction to loop.
1.How for loop works?
- For loop require 3 conditions to be executed correctly.
- for(condition1; condition2; condition3){
      std::cout<<"OUTPUT"}
- condition1: refer to starting point, value for the integer. Most peoples, refer integer as i.
  - eg; if the starting point is value 1, then the code for condition1 will be int i=1. So is the next number based on your choices.
- condition2: loop will iterate as long the i value meet the condition2.
  - eg; condition2 is i<=5. But, what does its mean ?.
  - To understand how condition2 functions, we have to look back to condition1.
  - condition2 are depend on condition1. So, if our i value is 1, isn't it make senses for 1<=5 ?. Because 1 is less, and a small number compare to 5.
  - The code meet what the condition2 want. Then it will move to condition3.
- condition3: the number will be either increment/decrement to start over the iteration back.
